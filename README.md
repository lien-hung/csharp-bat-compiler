# About
This is a simple project using a batch script to compile C# command-line programs with the computer's built-in .NET compiler, `csc.exe`.

# Instructions
1. Clone the repository into a folder: `C:\<some path>\csharp-bat-compiler`
2. Navigate to the folder in your terminal: `cd C:\<some path>\csharp-bat-compiler`
3. Compile the code file to an executable: `compiler test.cs`.
4. Run the executable with `test.exe`.

You can add your own C# code to the folder if you want, but make sure that your command include the full file name when compiling, generally `compiler <file-name>.cs`.
